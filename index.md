## Hi
I’m a junior iOS Developer located in Hungary. I have a passion for creating apps with beautiful UI, animations and intuitive, dynamic user experiences.
Since beginning my journey as an iOS Developer, I’ve published a indie app on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drinkspot-daily-drink-tracker/id1545770917), worked on multiple projects, and collaborated with talented people. 

In 2021, I've landed my first job as an iOS Developer, working at [CodeYard](https://codeyard.eu)
