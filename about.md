Self-taught developer based in Szeged, Hungary focused on iOS development. I love to create apps, the Xcode IDE, Swift & Objective-C languages are tools I use every day. 
I'm motivated by the positive impact that software could bring to change the life of individuals for the better, and transform them into real life projects.

I started learning iOS development about 2 years ago because I am fascinated by how mobile devices and applications influence our daily lives.
After many months of practicing and learning how to code in my spare time, I finally landed my first job as an iOS developer in July, 2021.
